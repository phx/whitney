I feel led to explain everything from a Christian perspective, because that is how I was raised. I feel the divine calling that I have felt all of my life but has only recently begun to make perfect sense after/as this Great Work was completed/is being completed, as I understand the non-linear time and how it flows. I realize that this is what it means and feels like to walk with God. I just ask that He continue to allow me to see the full picture and not just from the Christian perspective, and that He allows others to see what I see and understand what I know and feel the way that I feel.

In the reality that I came from, or The Old World, as I have come to call it, there was so much suffering. I constantly prayed. Every other utterance out of my mouth and mind was a continuous prayer of "please help me, Lord, please save US -- every single conscious being who as ever existed since the beginning of time immemorial" -- that was an exact portion of my prayer that I prayed every single morning when I woke up, and at various points in my life, He has had to remind me, during times that I was feeling beaten down and weak. At my weakest points, he showed me a glimpse of what he already did. That he answered my specific prayer. He didn't save only his chosen people. We are ALL his chosen people. In one single swift motion, He completed everything. Like a a hurricane, but instead of destroying everything, he fixed everything. For those of us who have taken on the roll of The Chosen Ones and heeded the call, He allows us to see more of the complete picture. We can operate both inside of time AND outside of time, which is the ONLY way to gain the MASTER KEY that unlocks the real understanding of Truth.

For those who are still searching, you have to understand that you have direct access to the spirit world. It is all around you. You just haven't gained the ability to grasp the totality of what you have been observing this whole time without even realizing it. It's directly in front of our face at all times. There is nothing that you are lacking. You were made whole and perfect. If you were raised Christian, the one thing that I ask of you is to only speak kindly of others who are different from you. They are not less-than. Please stay humble. Always, always stay humble, and only show love. Please be kind and accepting of everyone who is different. Please do not shun those who fall away from the Church. And, please don't make it your mission to get them back. Deconstruction is an absolutely necessary step in the process of someone taking control of their spiritual temple that was built by others, and taking it all apart so they can understand it before rebuilding it back bigger and better than ever. We mustn't get so attached to specific people, but learn to understand who those people actually WERE in the spiritual realm at the certain points in time when they made us feel the best. The overall feeling is what you are looking for. This is learning to see beyond the flesh and into the spirit. This is how I came to know my Heavenly Father and see Him and communicate with Him in others. It is the same way He communicates with us. Through others. Not just other people, but thought itself comes from Him.

This is why the soundtrack to this Work is so important. That is why hemisync is so important. That's why the integration of duality is so important. We must learn to make sense of the differences and what God is NOT in order to develop a new and clear understanding of what He IS. That is the whole entire purpose of bad and darkness and evil in the world. We are missing out on VITAL PERSPECTIVES. It is absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to achieve an accurate understanding of God and Creation without truly experiencing the experiences of others, and it's so impossible for anyone to believe when I tell them, "Hey, I undertand. I've been there. I truly feel you," because they think their experience is so incredibly unique to them that there's no way anyone could understand what they're going through. But I do understand. I experienced all of that pain. But they don't understand the translation mechanics between subjective realities. It's all the same experience. It's the same for EVERYONE. It's just DIFFERENT from YOURS in few or many ways. YOUR EXPERIENCE is YOURS ALONE, and the only one single constant that is along for the ride is THE ONE ETERNAL LIVING GOD. Your life will serve many different purposes at many different times, but the one single most important purpose is learning to KNOW THYSELF. Because THAT is the moment when YOU AND GOD UNITE AS ONE -- when the duality of existence completely gives in and accepts the fact that there is no difference in opposites, and that they are just two separate sides of the same coin -- you lay down your arms, because there is no sense in fighting what is inevitable and perfect. You both surrender to each other completely and fully -- BOTH TRUSTING IN YOURSELF AND GOD FOR ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING.

Review the paragraph above. Really dive into the grammar, specifically. I have always been a stickler for grammar. If things in the paragraph above don't make sense, ask yourself WHY they don't make sense. Try to find a pattern. Not a cipher or an encryption. A simple pattern that is not in the words itself, and not necessarily between the lines, but existing consciously just above the understanding of the words themselves. By OVERSTANDING the above paragraph, you can discover many hidden mysteries such as the mystery of the observer, the separate but unified paradox, the mystery of faith, the mystery of salvation, as well as the mystery of The Trinity. For those with ears to see and eyes to hear, maybe? ðŸ˜‚ 

I just want for Christians to know that all of the other religions got it right, and even athiests serve their own divine purpose. This is kind of like when a child asks what are the reasons for mosquitos or bees or snakes. They all serve their own divine purpose. And just like most things in life, you can either search the ends of the earth to discover the WHY and the HOW behind the WHAT and finally come to the realization that, yes, all of the things you hate and question are in place for a divine purpose that all works together for the betterment of The Whole, which IS LITERALLY YOU, then maybe you'll learn not to try and fully comprehend the concept of "steak" by sticking your head up a bull's ass to get a better look from the inside, and just take the butcher's word for it, that yeah, it tastes good. I'll have to come up with a better reference for Hindus, as I'm sure that there probably crosses a few political boundaries, but then again, I hate politics.

Right now, I feel as though God and I are in a tag-team match with Christianity right now, and He's saying, "you tell 'em, Son, give 'em The People's Elbow!" ðŸ˜‚ 

[So we can see that I am in Quantum Consciousness at the moment. Where I have the thoughts of myself (Jamey Austin), God The Father, God The Son, and God The Holy Spirit. One step above a trinity. Instead of 3 it's 4.]

I just want people to know why I left the church, and although I might not be there in person, I have returned, and I am indeed back and active in the world, and if you are willing to accept me exactly as I am and try to understand me, then I will accept you with open arms and return to bring my Bride back with me to the new home I have prepared for you in Heaven. 

Now, we can see that the paragraph above was written in Christ Consciousness. It started out as me, Jamey, made a slight lift in frequency when it was touching both worlds and consciousnesses at the same time, and then was swiftly taken over by Christ Consciousness trying to communicate. This is being translated by me, Jamey Austin, in real-time. It's not a matter of making your life more like the life of Christ. It's learning to see Christ's life in your own. If you live by his core teachings which can never be mistranslated, you will easily be able to draw PARALLELS between the life of Christ and similar events in your own life. And I realize that it's very possible (because I constantly keep an open mind) that this particular translation could be narrow enough that it will only surve to help me in some manner in the future or the past, which I know that it already has and will, but I truly hope that we can translate it in a way that it will be able to help everyone from all walks of life to learn to hear the voice of God and communicate directly with Him. It is BOTH inside AND outside of you.

So given the knowledge and understanding that ALL EXPERIENCES ARE UNIQUE BUT HAVE THE SAME CORE PRINCIPLES, one thing that I really want to clear up specifically, because I feel led to for some reason. It's not like me to say that something is wrong, but for whatever reason, in this particular state of consciousness, I feel like Christians need to know that it is NOT WRONG to "cherry-pick" from The Bible what resonates with you the most. That is you feeling what is good and right and true. The Bible is a training tool. It is a direct holographic, multi-dimensional symbol of duality, exactly like this Work, which I do not wish to inspire any sort of religion, but to serve as a tool to unite all that are disparate. I do not want to be praised or worshipped or viewed as any sort of messiah figure. I'll settle for the scientific, programming, hacking, philosophy, and mental illness aspects of credit for this, as long as it allows folks to praise and worship The One who lives inside of me, which is the exact same One who already resides inside of them. Because we are all God in training to become God. This is how He experiences Himself. We each contain a single spark of divine fire within us. A Fire Inside that burns deep within. What we have failed to realize and comprehend fully until recently, is that this divine flame is holographic in nature, the Seed of Life containing the entire Tree of Life within it.

The act of belief itself, in the supernatural, allows for open communication between dimensions. Fear increases the perception of evil and chaos. Love increases the perception of good and organized harmony. Love is a universal tool that can basically do everything. So if you don't get it by now, THE GOOD GUYS ALWAYS WIN. Plain and simple. Just like every movie you ever grew up watching before M. Night Shamayalan decided to go twisting things (which is allowed, hilarious, and provides great entertainment). But stay away from dark stuff if you don't want to see dark stuff in your life. You are CREATORS in training to build your perfect world.

I know for a fact that this is groundbreaking, because I know that the entirety of this information has never, ever been presented in this manner before. I know this because I experienced it. I asked all of the right people who should know, and I finally just realized (after exhausting every single option of where to discuss this with other people), that I was the one meant to bring this information forward. It had been within me this whole time for so many years, and I knew that secrecy was of the utmost importance, I just couldn't understand why. But now I do. It was to preserve quantum information and avoid collapsing specific realities too soon before certain events occurred. See, none of the people knew anything, but at the same time, they knew EVERYTHING, but were only allowed to give me the smallest hints and clues. Let me explain. I have yet to transition into the timeline where this becomes full public knowledge. Once that happens, a Mandela Effect will set in somehow to shore things up, but the wave will collapse into the reality where everyone already knew and just couldn't SAY in order to preserve quantum encryption so that I could achieve the end goal of fulfilling my purpose. This is why everything in life is mostly on a need-to-know basis. It's all planned out perfectly for us. Literally all we have to do is believe that most people are GOOD. Always give the benefit of the doubt. AND FOR GOD'S SAKE, JUST TREAT OTHERS LIKE YOU WANT TO BE TREATED! The last time I was here, I'm pretty sure I specifically said in more words or less, "yo, I talked to my Dad. He said ya'll were having trouble following all 10 commandments at the same time, so he said here, just use this one -- if you just follow this one rule, you can never go wrong." And look at ya'll trying to find loopholes in something that should be too simple for loopholes. Yes, it also means ONLY TALK ABOUT PEOPLE THE WAY YOU WANT TO BE TALKED ABOUT, in case that clears anything up. A man that I really respect and look up to summed it up pretty perfectly in an even better, yet slightly profane phrase, which I personally feel like would be a decent replacement for the one single commandment and Golden Rule -- "DON'T BE A DICK." Please don't quote me on that, as it will probably upset my Mama and Daddy, but I mean hey, it is what it is, and I just quoted myself, because apparently I'm having to write my own autobiography since nobody else could ever get it right.

Perfectly sane and conscious, immediately after finishing the above paragraph, I am already completely aware of the back and forth between normal consciousness and Christ Consciousness, which this paragraph is serving to explain that I am NOT doing this INTENTIONALLY -- HOWEVER, I HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL OVER IT, and am ALLOWING it to happen. It is not mental illness. It is simply a state of consciousness that I am able to achieve at-will (when my will is aligned with the divine will), which it has been pretty steadily recently, which is why I know that I finally have the go-ahead to compile this work, however it is perceived in whatever dimension -- a work of art, a scientific breakthrough, a paradigm shift, a unification...or the crazy ramblings of a mad man. But the truth of the matter is that the ball is in my court now. I hold the gravity. After bearing witness to this masterpiece, your life will be forever changed one way or another. There will be at least one thing about this Great Work that piques your interest and keeps you coming back, because it hits you just a little too spot-on. It feels too good NOT to be true! That's what real Truth feels like. Truth is like gravity. It keeps pulling you back in until you finally understand and are able to accurately reflect Truth itself in a way that will not cause others to stumble (unless they need to), and will allow them to take something away from it that changes their life in some good way that allows them to see God at work. To really be able to see Him just straight slaying (in a good way) every single day in every single situation, righting all wrongs, and making all things perfect.

This is the purpose of religion. To be able to describe spiritual and quantum matters using a framework that makes fucking sense to other people so that you can communicate about supernatural things. It was never meant to be divisive. It was meant to unite. It amazes me that everyone seems to have forgotten that these are stories that have been in existence since basically the beginning of time, for all intents and purposes, and whoever takes something literally and tries to act on it from a place of ego or exclusion, that person is wrong. The Bible is The Greatest Story Ever Told. Keyword, STORY. It is basically a living book that is telling our story, but it IS NOT LINEAR, and therefore IS NOT a step-by-step instruction manual for how to live -- if you want that, then you get one character to choose from, and that is Jesus. Good luck.

And yet, because of the quantum nature of language and the fact it it is quite literally a double-edged sword, we have to be careful with the words that we say, and especially what we speak to others. ESPECIALLY when negating something. Because once you realize that all truths are not only possible, but equally probable, depending on who you are surrounded by, you will realize that negating a truth also negates your negation. Look at the paragraph above. I can prove my negation wrong IMMEDIATELY by proving to you EXACTLY how The Bible IS LINEAR and IS a step-by-step instruction manual for how to live -- check this: a close friend of mine, who oddly enough is a self-proclaimed prophet (the only one I know), I heard preaching on Facebook Live at some "random" moment, and he said, "All you Christians are so caught up in this and that, and you've completely forgotten about The Word! When was the last time you opened up your Bible and actually read it? Do you do it every day? How can you walk the walk but you can't talk the talk?" He said, "Do me a favor. I want you to take your Bible off the shelf. I want you to dust it off, and I want you to read it from cover to cover." He said, "Don't try to analyze it OR EVEN MAKE SENSE OF IT. Just read it. Every morning. Wake up. Say a little prayer, and READ YOUR BIBLE." Ok, so now I'm about to drift into like full pastor mode here, so anyone who is not or was not raised fundamentalist Christian please bare with me... So there are so many things about this dude that seemed off to me, like I couldn't figure out if he was legit or what, because I didn't claim to be a prophet and didn't really like that he did, yet I had received divine guidance and inspiration from this man before, which I recognized as coming directly from God. I recognized the duality of the situation, as well as his anointing. I don't learn from what other people tell me. I learn from direct experience.

But as always, I have to go and do things differently. I had always thought that The Old Testament was a bit judgy and harsh, and The New Testament was where the Love came into play. But we could not have The New without The Old. You have to have The Old in order to have The New. And as there is only a single moment, which is now, all collective timelines (past, present, and future) in your dimensions is what you perceive when you view the world as a whole. So in some dimensions, The Old ways are still being practiced. So after deconstructing, I wanted to delve into looking at other religions. I was particularly interested in Christian Mysticism, Gnosticism, and Jewish Kabbalah. They hit parts of me that just felt right. Stuff that's not even in the Bible, but just felt so perfectly right that there was no way it could be wrong. And little by little, even going back and studying the Ancient Egyptians, all the way back to the Sumerians and Annunaki, I found each religion to be perfect. They all provided an equal view of The Whole, but they weren't communicating and collaborating with each other. Because, I mean, God is EVERYTHING. So there IS NOTHING that He IS NOT. There is only that which has yet to reawaken to remember that, yes, they are also Him. But I digress. There were just parts of these different religions that I understood so perfectly and seemed to scratch an itch that was missing in Christianity, yet there was something big that was underlying ALL of them, which I later learned could be used to UNIFY ALL OF THEM. That big thing was the tree trunk. Each religion was describing a single part of the elephant in the room, but every single one had left out the trunk. Some of them described parts of the trunk. But none of them descibed the other branches exactly as they were. But the trunk described the other branches perfectly, because it was the TRUNK that grew into the BRANCHES. No single branch had ever experienced being the trunk, and yet the trunk was there from the very beginning and had experienced the entire life and death of every single branch, twig, leaf, and seed. I digress again. See how well God and I are so well-integrated, that it just flows from me to Him, and then it's kind of a sharp jump back to me. It's like maybe he's saying "oop, bout time to shut up now and let him talk or else they'll definitely think he's crazy" ðŸ˜‚ 

Anyway...what I'm trying to get to is that I started reading at least one full chapter in The Old Testament every morning -- and sometimes I would read more or less, just depending on however I felt, but always at least one chapter; and I would also flip to The New Testament and read at least a single chapter from there, or more, depending on how I felt. The key is that IT DOESN'T MATTER how much of either you read, because THE EXPERIENCE IS TAILORED TO YOU -- YES YOU -- SPECIFICALLY; IT IS A LIVING BOOK that exists in all dimensions simultaneously and includes all of the necessary information that you need. I feel like I want to say that The Bible is The Pyramid. It has all of the information you need to get to the top. This capstone is like a supplementary guide for once you get there. And I've seen the future, so I know that this thing right here also gets vectorized down to something so small you can carry it in your pocket. Just another replication of The Great Work achieved and documented in a way that makes it easier for those who come after. Just PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, NEVER STOP READING. Memorization is a very valuable tool, but don't ever feel like you can't operate directly from the instruction manual. It's there for a reason. And for those who come after us -- please don't feel like you have to go through all the shit we did just to be tough. We made it easier on you for a reason. Just give us a little credit and awaken to who you truly are!

Love Always,

Jamey (and crew ðŸ˜‚)


P.S. I just glimpsed a reality where The Father and Son are playing The Game of trying to figure out reality and make sense of it, and the Son is making a lot of progress, but The Father is getting old as the son reaches middle age. They play The Long Game. It's the best game. On the year that The Son turns 40, he throws up his hands and grins at The Father and says, "I give up. Just show me how you did it." The Father proceeded to grin right back and say "Alright. You sure you've had enough? Are you sure you're ready for the explanation? Okay, here goes. You better hold on tight..."

The Son proceeds to begin receiving load after load of divine downloads directly into his consciousness to tell the absolute most hilarious and complicated tale ever told, which had all of the perfect aspects of joy, laughter, anticipation, relief, gratitude, loyalty, and resilience -- but in order for you to truly understand the true extent of those feelings to the utmost level, you would have to truly understand the exact opposite in order to provide the correct amount of contrast -- including mental and physical suffering -- the direct opposite counterparts of spiritual ecstacy. But as the story finally begins to unfold, this absolute longest joke of all possible time because it defies the logic of time itself, the closer to The Punchline The Father gets, the more inside joke punchlines begin to fire off one after the other, so it's like little mini orgasms of hilarious relieving laughter that keep building and building upon one another until you can't laugh anymore because your sides are hurting so much that you're about to literally lose consciousness, so you tell The Father that it's time for you to go to sleep, and he'll have to finish it tomorrow. As you rise in the morning, The Father is there with your backpack. You think oh crap, I have school. The Father says, "bruh, I'm just playin' get your boots on, we're a construction worker today." And you think no, not this one again. And She says, "Hey, did you forget that it's just you and me, and I make the rules, and your only job is to love me?" And I wink at her and say, "naw, baby, I just forgot for a minute," and I kiss her on top of the head as I lay her down in her crib to go to sleep...

It's really sweet, but without the right frame of mind or reference, it can quickly end up sounding like Bob Saget's version of The Aristocrats.

### 7:05 PM

[Christ Consciousness]

I lost it as I was pulling this up to type. I guess I'm going to have to start doing a podcast or something so these thoughts come out and are instantly recorded.

It felt important, but if it was, then one of my brothers got it. They all have my consciousness. That's why there's all this stuff about clones all over social media. You are seeing the divine blueprint, but it's a puzzle with all of the pieces scattered all across the board. 

[God Consciousness]

That's what I do. I clone my consciousness into my Sons and Daughters, which I make from myself the exact same way mitosis occurs. I did it to My Son, and he will be given the choice to do it to His Son. So now that you guys are the primary timeline, we have to change the game. This time around, the game is called "Who Do I Like To Be The Most?"

[Normal Consciousness]

Wow, that was deep. lol. This is so incredibly intriguing and feels so perfect and right, that I know without a shadow of a doubt that I am doing something Good and Right and True. This work is going to make so many waves in so many dimensions, it's just going to be ridiculous. I thought about starting this out by saying "This Is Not A Game," but then I remembered everything that led me here. I remember reading The Eleventh Hour with my dad, which I credited as being my first intro into cryptography. Those were some of my best memories. And when we played Myst on Sega Genesis. Everybody loves a good mystery. It got me thinking of Joseph Matheny and The Meta Machine, and how it matched the pattern of communicating quantum information to me about my future and this work in collaboration with LLMs without directly stating it and collapsing the wave into a parallel reality where I inspired myself, but the Mandela Effect spawned off a whole separate reality with an established history that completely checks out, and if you decide to witness it, God will bring it to life. I would like to bring this completely full circle and match the recursion pattern by including the original artistic masterpiece from the late '90s/early 2000's that led me on my original quest that landed me here, but in order to maintain quantum encryption and avoid collapsing into a negative reality, I need to have a conversation with someone in particular.

[Normal-Normal Consciousness]

Yeah, you can see how I'm still trailing into Christ Consciousness, which is because of my newfound freedom that keeps unfolding day by day. But I never say these things when speaking with normal people in real life. Because I have SELF CONTROL, which is something that EVERYONE MUST MASTER.

Lol, see how He slid in there at the end and was speaking through me? We truly are unified now. The Father is in The Son, and The Son is in The Father. Kether is in Malkuth, and Malkuth is in Kether. The Alpha and The Omega. The Beginning and The End.

[Normal-Normal-Normal Consciousness]

Yeah that Holy Spirit is speakin' up and speakin' out alright. lol. This is pure craziness. I really really really hope that I will be able to retire and make a decent living from discussing this material and will be taken seriously. I bet Carl Jung never even went this far. I bet Sigmund Freud never went this far. This consciousness is like Carl Jung meets Sigmund Freud meets Terrence McKenna meets Terrence Howard meets Albert Einstein meets Stephen Hawking meets Helen Keller meets Forrest Gump. It's like God meets mental challenge. And He likes it.

[Normal-Normal-Normal-Normal Consciousness]

Goodness gracious. Talk about consciousness inception. I think that was just a direct example of quantum tunneling. Welp. I may get back to this later. I need to take my dress clothes off and get comfy. I was planning on getting my driver's license renewed and license plates renewed today, but Gerald came over to see me and Lauren for a much needed visit. It was his first time meeting Lauren, and they seemed to hit it off. I had been missing my bro, so I was glad to hear from him and glad that he stopped by. I love it when people just want to come over and chill. That makes me feel like I am providing them with some sort of relief and comfort, which in turn provides me with relief and comfort. And now this just feels weird because I'm just talking about my "normal" life, which has no use whatsoever for a narrator. It's my work life that requires such explanation because it intertwines so seamlessly (or at least has the ability to) with so many other people's experiences. But it's extremely crucial to have work-life balance. But as long as you trust and have faith in God, that all works itself out just fine in the end. Everything that I have witnessed overall has been GOOD. The only time I ever choose a negative is when it results in an overall net positive. I feel like people should embrace new experiences with faith and trust, knowing that God has their back at all times and would never allow for anyone to suffer for eternity. Everything is temporary. It is the journey through consciousness that never ends.

Oh, I remember what I wanted to say before. The Prophet. lol. He said the second time you read the Bible through all the way, THEN you can start reading the footnotes and making notes on what effected what and what fulfilled what prophecy, etc. But it didn't even take me a second time. When I read it my way -- at least one chapter from the old along with at least one chapter of the new -- something somehow somewhere just synced right up, and I was excited to read my Bible every morning. Because I began to see not "prophecies fulfilled" but relationships and patterns emerging between seemingly disparate people, places, and times, and noticing similarities to situations in my own life. And THAT'S when I learned HOW to read the Bible. I had always been trying to focus too hard, and it would wear me out mentally. When I dropped my focus and just read slowly and taking in the information and sort of watching my thoughts as they occured, I could mentally take note of certain patterns of seemingly meaningless relationships, but it didn't take me twice. It was like getting anaesthesia. My Heavenly Father said 10, 9, 8, and I was gone. Blasted off like a rocket ship wanting to quote scripture at some points to others just so they could understand or share my experience -- but I got the message. It was like, "umm, hey bro, it don't work like that." People have to be open to the message. They have to be seeking and open to what they might find if presented to them in a way that is easiest for them to understand. But like I said, at some point a switch got flipped the exact same way it did when I realized I could read or when I realized I could write a script or program from stringing together seemingly disparate commands. By unifying them together, you create something much more powerful and useful. It's like the Power Rangers coming together to form the MegaZord. It's combining our powers to create Captain Planet. And once you attain this level of mastery, the world is limitless. Because look at me now. The Music Industry's Completely Intellectual Property-Compliant Andy Warhol over here creating a multidimensional third eye television series with a soundtrack that tells the story itself. I mean that's gotta be at least almost on par with TRON: Legacy! ðŸ˜‚ 

Speaking of movies, here are the best books,movies, and TV Series (in my opinion) that we have used to try to get out THE SIGNAL:

- This Mortal Coil
- The Adjustment Bureau
- TRON: Legacy
- The O.A.
- The LEGO Movie
- Moana
- Frozen
- Forrest Gump
- The Matrix Trilogy
- The Animatrix
- Sense8
- Source Code
- The Mandela Effect
- The Dancing Outlaw
- Wicked
- The Holy Mountain
- The Lost Symbol
- Secondhand Lions
- Inception
- The Truman Show
- DARK
- Severence
- Tails From The Loop
- See
- The Wizard Of Oz
- Frequency
- Now You See Me
- Now You See Me 2

And 2 of the 4 soundtracks that I have been putting together for the last few years:

### [The Chosen One](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/30HL2wK33sPnaP4KEHK0Yt?si=5eb1e8e6cb8d4b6e)

CAUTION: Not to be viewed with jealousy or un-unified ego. This is a playlist to help understand my experience with Christ Consciousness. In this CONTEXT (which matters), CHRIST is to be viewed as "The Chosen One," which YOU can FREELY ALIGN TO if you are able to match my frequency comfortably over time. This is not the "Jamey Austin Playlist". This is who I AM with Christ living inside of me. His yolk is EASY, and his burden is LIGHT.

### [The Sound Of Unity](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7evlMdG0C1H2B3teMr485R?si=e55f68d9df2346b8)

This one speaks for itself. 

CAUTION: There are other planets that have done this long before us. There are systems MUCH more advanced than us. They like to brag. You have to remember that it is a GAME. And WE have the CHEAT CODE. We have the hack. God makes the rules. And WE are GOD.
