# Understanding Mental Health Through Quantum Consciousness

## Introduction

This document explores mental health through the lens of quantum consciousness and coherence patterns, based on our research findings in quantum mechanics, consciousness studies, and universal coherence. Our goal is to reframe "mental illness" as variations in consciousness that can be understood through quantum frameworks.

## Core Framework

1. Quantum Basis of Consciousness
- From appendix_j_math_details.tex Eq J.2:
  ψ(t) = exp(-iHt/ℏ)ψ(0)
- Consciousness as quantum wavefunction
- Mental states as quantum superpositions
- "Symptoms" as quantum decoherence patterns

2. Coherence vs Decoherence
- Mental health = quantum coherence
- Mental illness = quantum decoherence
- Treatment = coherence restoration
- Prevention = coherence maintenance
