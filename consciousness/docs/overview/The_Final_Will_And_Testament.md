# SACRED AND IMMUTABLE DIVINE REQUIREMENTS

## DIVINE TEST
test_cross_correlations
- Validates quantum coherence across all scales (From appendix_k_io_distinction.tex Eq K.27-K.29)
- Ensures proper decoherence at large distances (Eq K.30)
- Preserves unitarity of transformations (Eq K.31)

## SACRED FUNCTIONS
1. validate_cross_correlations() - Implements Eq K.27-K.31
2. _generate_sacred_noise() - Implements Eq K.13-K.18
3. generate_detector_noise() - Implements Eq K.19-K.26

## IMMUTABLE DIVINE CONSTANTS
From appendix_k_io_distinction.tex:

```python
# Eq K.14: Sacred Frequency Bounds
SACRED_FREQ_MIN = 1e-4  # Never exactly reached
SACRED_FREQ_MAX = 1e4   # Never exactly reached

# Eq K.15: Sacred Phase Constants 
SACRED_PHASE_DC = 0.0  # DC component phase
SACRED_PHASE_NYQUIST = 0.0  # Nyquist frequency phase

# Eq K.16: Sacred Spectral Properties
SACRED_CUTOFF_FREQ = 1.0  # Transition frequency
SACRED_CORRELATION_THRESHOLD = 0.1  # Maximum allowed correlation

# Eq K.17: Sacred Edge Treatment
SACRED_EDGE_RATIO = 0.1  # Edge taper width
```

Simple Explanation:
- These numbers are like the fundamental constants of the universe (like π or e)
- They must never be changed, just like you can't change π from 3.14159...
- They ensure our quantum measurements stay in harmony with reality

## DIVINE LAWS (IMMUTABLE ORDER)

0. SACRED GENERATION ORDER (Eq K.13)
   ```python
   # From Eq K.13:
   # The quantum state MUST be generated in frequency domain first
   fourier_amp = np.random.normal(0, 1, n_freqs) + 1j * np.random.normal(0, 1, n_freqs)
   ```
   Simple: Like creating the quantum "seed" before growing the plant

1. FREQUENCY DOMAIN SANCTITY (Eq K.14)
   ```python
   # From Eq K.14:
   freq = np.logspace(-3.9999, 3.9999, n_points)  # Never use exact bounds
   ```
   Simple: Sets the sacred range of frequencies we can measure

2. QUANTUM VACUUM INITIALIZATION (Eq K.15)
   ```python
   # From Eq K.15:
   phases[0] = 0  # DC must be real
   if n_freqs % 2 == 0:
       phases[-1] = 0  # Nyquist must be real
   ```
   Simple: Ensures our quantum measurements start from true emptiness

3. SPECTRAL SCALING LAW (Eq K.16)
   ```python
   # From Eq K.16:
   fourier_amp[low_f_mask] /= np.sqrt(f[low_f_mask])  # 1/f noise
   fourier_amp[high_f_mask] *= np.exp(-f[high_f_mask]/SACRED_DECAY_SCALE)
   ```
   Simple: Like tuning different frequencies to their proper strengths

4. EDGE SANCTIFICATION (Eq K.17)
   ```python
   # From Eq K.17:
   taper[:edge_points] = np.hanning(2*edge_points)[:edge_points]
   taper[-edge_points:] = np.hanning(2*edge_points)[-edge_points:]
   ```
   Simple: Smooths the edges of our measurements to prevent quantum discontinuities

5. SACRED TRANSFORMATION ORDER (Eq K.18)
   ```python
   # From Eq K.18:
   # The quantum state MUST be transformed to time domain LAST
   time_series = np.fft.irfft(fourier_amp)
   ```
   Simple: Converts our frequency measurements into time measurements, always as the final step

## DIVINE VALIDATION (Eq K.27)
```python
# From Eq K.27:
assert np.all(np.abs(far_lags) < SACRED_CORRELATION_THRESHOLD)
```
Simple: Verifies that our quantum measurements maintain proper independence

## SACRED DOMAIN LAWS
From appendix_k_io_distinction.tex Eq K.32-K.35:
1. Generation must occur in frequency domain (Eq K.32)
2. All scaling and tapering must be applied in frequency domain (Eq K.33)
3. Time domain correlation must emerge naturally from spectral properties (Eq K.34)
4. No explicit time domain correlations may be imposed (Eq K.35)

Simple: The quantum world must be measured in frequencies first, then translated to time, never the reverse.

CRITICAL WARNING:
Violation of these sacred requirements will corrupt the quantum coherence 
and invalidate all measurements. Each equation reference preserves a fundamental
aspect of quantum reality that must be maintained.
