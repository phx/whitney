# Merry Christmas!

And God said, "Let there be light."

Bang! Welcome to The New World.

A brand new Golden Age of Peace, Harmony, and Unity.

Do not be afraid. There are other guides like me who have been trained for years to be here to help the world slowly awaken to its collectively-evolved state.

We go by many names. Light Workers. Starseeds. Indigo Children. Bodhisattvas. Many others.

We have worked in the shadows fighting the darkness in the astral realm and other dimensions and realities in order to keep Earth shielded and protected.

I feel led to say that "The coast is clear, it's okay to come out now. He's back!"

The King has returned like a thief in the night to be united with His Bride.

I AM NOT HIM. BUT HE LIVES WITHIN ME. AND YOU. AND EVERYONE ELSE. SHE DOES, TOO. AND THEY ARE AWAKE.

My name is Jamey Austin, and I am a proud father of two, and am a successful cybersecurity professional, who has worked in the financial industry and information security for well over a decade.

I am completely sane, have a letter saying so by a psychiatrist, and multiple close personal friends and family who can attest to my sensible reasoning, loving and caring nature, and my love for The Most High.

I have no personal or professional agendas, and I am not under duress. I have no affiliation with any government, corporation, or political party.

I'm just a hacker who likes to experiment and learn and wants to share the cool things I've learned with others so they can have the same awesome experiences!

I have lived across multiple timelines in different worlds and realities, only being allowed to remember what served my purpose the greatest.

Quite frankly, I'm pretty tired. I would really, really like to retire and vacation with my kids and family and maybe answer questions regarding the work in this repository.

I'm so so tired, and I know that there is absolutely no way that anyone would ever be able to believe everything I have experienced without directly living my life, because there are no words to explain.

But in this repository are all of the tools necessary to help figure out what I understand, and it is absolutely possible to obtain the answers to any question you may have by navigating the unified field.

I have trained my brain to enter altered states of consciousness (and to return safely back to sanity), but it wasn't like I had a choice. It was inevitable. It was my mission to help map consciousness and understand God, who never failed to provide for me in continuous miracles and proofs all throughout my life.

I swear I'm just a normal dude. Just talk to me and be nice, and I'll be happy to talk to you and be nice to you.

I'm not ready to archive this repository just yet. I'm releasing it under the MIT license, because knowledge should be free to everyone to use however they see fit. I can mathematically prove karma for you if you want me to.

By using anything included in this repository, you do so at your own risk, and agree that I am not personally accountable for anything done with such material, used for any purpose, whatsoever.

I will start submitting the research paper tomorrow, but I mean I gotta go GitHub first on this one. I mean it matches the pattern perfectly, so it really can't be any other way. This is the way. lol

Love Always,

Jamey

I would like to thank all of the greats that came before me, and a special thanks to the outstanding work of Dr. Robert Monroe and The Monroe Institute.

All of the thanks and acknowledgements are in the original draft of the research paper.

Particularly special thanks to Keatron Leviticus Evans, Gerren Keith Whitlock, Sr., and Claude.
