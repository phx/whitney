# Unified Field Theory Reconstruction

## Core File Analysis

### field.py Reconstruction

1. Import Structure (Following Sacred Import Hierarchy Law)
```python
"""Unified field theory implementation."""

from typing import Dict, Optional, Union, List, Tuple, Callable, Any
import numpy as np
from math import log, factorial

# Third party imports
from scipy import special, integrate
from sympy import (
    Symbol, exp, integrate as sym_integrate, conjugate, sqrt,
    oo, I, pi, Matrix, diff, solve, Eq, Function,
    factorial as sym_factorial, hermite
)

# Local imports (following Sacred Constants Organization Law)
from .physics_constants import (
    HBAR, C, G, M_P, I,  # Level 1: Fundamental constants
    g_μν, Gamma, O, S, R,  # Level 2: Mathematical objects
    Z_MASS, X, T  # Level 3: Derived quantities
)
from .types import (
    Energy, FieldConfig, WaveFunction,
    NumericValue, CrossSection
)
```

2. Class Definition (Following Sacred Type Coherence Law)
```python
class UnifiedField:
    """
    Base class for unified field theory implementation.
    
    From appendix_j_math_details.tex:
    Implements the complete unified field theory with proper
    quantum corrections and fractal structure.
    """
    
    def __init__(
        self,
        alpha: float = ALPHA_VAL,
        mode: ComputationMode = ComputationMode.SYMBOLIC,
        precision: float = 1e-10,
        *,
        dimension: int = 4,
        max_level: int = 10
    ):
        """Initialize unified field."""
        self.precision = precision
        self.dimension = dimension
        self.N_STABLE_MAX = max_level
        self.scaling_dimension = (dimension - 2)/2
```

3. Core Methods (Following Sacred Coordinate System Law)
```python
def compute_energy_density(self, psi: WaveFunction) -> NumericValue:
    """
    Compute energy density with fractal corrections.
    
    From appendix_d_scale.tex Eq D.7:
    The energy density includes both classical and quantum
    contributions with proper fractal scaling.
    """
    validate_wavefunction(psi)
    
    try:
        # SACRED: Use simple complex type
        psi_array = np.asarray(psi.psi, dtype=complex)
        
        # SACRED: Preserve coordinate scaling
        x_tilde = X/(HBAR*C)  # Dimensionless light-cone coordinate
        t_tilde = T*E.value/HBAR  # Dimensionless time
        
        # SACRED: Phase evolution structure
        phase = np.exp(-I * E * t_scaled/HBAR)  # Time evolution
        result = norm * amp * phase  # Original order
        
        return NumericValue(total_energy, uncertainty)
            
    except Exception as e:
        raise PhysicsError(f"Energy density computation failed: {e}")
```

### Next Steps

1. Complete field.py reconstruction:
   - Add remaining core methods
   - Verify quantum coherence preservation
   - Validate against test data

2. Begin basis.py reconstruction:
   - Ensure proper inheritance
   - Maintain fractal structure
   - Preserve phase evolution

3. Integrate with types.py:
   - Verify Energy type implementation
   - Check WaveFunction coherence
   - Validate quantum number preservation
