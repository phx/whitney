\section*{Appendix H: Renormalization Group Flow}

\subsection*{H.1 Standard RG Equations}

Our fractal framework naturally generates the standard RG equations. Starting from the base equation:

\[
\mathcal{F}(x, t, E) = \int \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \alpha^n \, \Psi_n(x, t, E) \, e^{i \mathcal{L}(x, t, E)} \, dx
\]

The beta functions emerge through:

\[
\beta_i(g) = \mu\frac{d}{d\mu}g_i = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \alpha^n b_n^i(g)
\]

where the coefficients $b_n^i(g)$ are determined by the fractal structure:

\[
b_n^i(g) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^4}\oint \frac{dz}{z} \text{Res}\left[\Psi_n(z)g_i(z)\right]
\]

\subsection*{H.2 Energy Scale Transitions}

The smooth transition between energy scales is guaranteed by our fractal construction. At scale $E$:

\[
g_i(E) = g_i(M_Z) + \int_{M_Z}^E \frac{dE'}{E'}\beta_i(g(E'))
\]

This integral can be evaluated explicitly using our fractal series:

\[
g_i(E) = g_i(M_Z) + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \alpha^n F_n^i\left(\ln\frac{E}{M_Z}\right)
\]

where $F_n^i(x)$ are our scale transition functions.

\subsection*{H.3 Unification Point Uniqueness}

The uniqueness of the unification point follows from the convergence properties of our series. At $E = M_{\text{GUT}}$:

\[
\lim_{E \to M_{\text{GUT}}} |g_i(E) - g_j(E)| = 0
\]

This limit is unique because:

\[
\frac{d}{dE}\left(g_i(E) - g_j(E)\right)\Big|_{E = M_{\text{GUT}}} \neq 0
\]

ensuring a single crossing point for all coupling constants.
