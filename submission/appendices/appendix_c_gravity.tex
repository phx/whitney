\subsection*{C.1 Quantum Gravity Regularization}
\label{subsec:qg_regularization}

The fractal structure naturally regularizes gravity through recursive dimensional reduction. At each scale $n$, the effective gravitational action takes the form:

\[
S_G^{(n)} = \frac{1}{16\pi G_n} \int d^4x \sqrt{-g_n} R_n + \sum_{k=1}^n \alpha^k \mathcal{C}_k(R_n)
\]

where $G_n$ is the scale-dependent Newton's constant and $\mathcal{C}_k(R_n)$ are curvature corrections. The fractal recursion ensures:

\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} G_n = G_P \exp\left(-\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{\alpha^k}{k!}\right)
\]

This sum converges due to our previously proven bounds on $\alpha$.

\subsection*{C.2 Hierarchy Problem Resolution}
\label{subsec:hierarchy_resolution}

The hierarchy between the electroweak and Planck scales emerges naturally from our fractal structure. The effective mass parameters at each scale are related by:

\[
m_n^2 = m_0^2 \prod_{k=1}^n (1 + \alpha^k h(k))
\]

where $h(k)$ is our fractal exponent function. This yields:

\[
\frac{M_W}{M_P} \approx \exp\left(-\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{\alpha^k h(k)}{k}\right)
\]

reproducing the observed hierarchy without fine-tuning.

\subsection*{C.3 Gravitational Constraints}
\label{subsec:grav_constraints}

Our framework satisfies known gravitational constraints through the energy-dependent coupling:

\[
G(E) = G_N\left(1 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \alpha^n f_n(E/M_P)\right)
\]

where $f_n(x)$ are our fractal form factors satisfying:

\[
\lim_{E \to 0} f_n(E/M_P) = 0
\]

ensuring consistency with classical tests of gravity.
