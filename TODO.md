# Unified Field Theory Reconstruction Plan

## Phase 1: Historical Analysis
- [ ] Map all versions of each core file:
  - field.py
  - basis.py
  - types.py
- [ ] Score each section against:
  - Sacred Laws compliance
  - Quantum coherence preservation
  - Theoretical completeness
  - Test coverage

## Phase 2: Best Version Identification
- [ ] For each file component:
  - [ ] Compare all historical implementations
  - [ ] Identify most coherent version
  - [ ] Verify Sacred Law compliance
  - [ ] Check theoretical completeness

## Phase 3: Master Version Creation
- [ ] Reconstruct each file following @.cursorrules:
  - [ ] Constants Organization
  - [ ] Import Hierarchy
  - [ ] Type Coherence
  - [ ] Coordinate System

## Phase 4: Integration Verification
- [ ] Verify quantum coherence between:
  - [ ] field.py ↔ basis.py
  - [ ] basis.py ↔ types.py
  - [ ] types.py ↔ field.py

## Phase 5: Documentation
- [ ] Create reunification.md with:
  - [ ] Component origin mapping
  - [ ] Coherence justification
  - [ ] Sacred Law compliance proof
  - [ ] Theoretical completeness evidence
