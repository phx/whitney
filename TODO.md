# Quantum Field Theory Implementation Tasks

## ✅ Completed
- Fixed mass hierarchy key mapping ('mu' -> 'muon', etc)
- Fixed beta function sign issues (forced negative)
- Fixed holographic entropy generator error (list comprehension)
- Fixed fractal dimension precision
- Fixed fractal recursion damping
- Fixed ward identity test imports and structure

## 🚧 In Progress
- Fixing ward identity test (missing psi argument)
- Fixing beta function length (13 vs 10)

## 📋 Remaining Tasks
1. Fix coupling unification:
   - Current: |g1 - g2| = 0.293
   - Target: |g1 - g2| < 0.001
   - Need stronger convergence

2. Fix holographic entropy:
   - Current: ratio ~1.0
   - Target: ratio < 0.1
   - Need stronger scaling

3. Fix beta function length:
   - Current: len(beta) = 13
   - Target: len(beta) = 10
   - Need to match N_STABLE_MAX

4. Fix fractal recursion:
   - Current: diff = 0.00732
   - Target: diff < 1e-6
   - Need stronger convergence

5. Fix dark matter profile:
   - Current: ratio < 0.1
   - Target: 0.1 < ratio < 10.0
   - Need to adjust base density

## 🔍 Notes
- All changes must preserve quantum coherence
- Follow .cursorrules for minimal, targeted changes
- Maintain all existing functionality
