# A Recursive, Holographic, and Scale-Dependent Framework for Grand Unification

## Overview

This repository presents a novel theoretical approach to Grand Unified Theories (GUTs)
that explores the integration of fractal self-similarity, holographic principles,
and scale-dependent coupling evolution. The framework shows promising results in
reproducing Standard Model features while suggesting possible paths to quantum
gravity integration.

## Key Features

- **Fractal Field Structure**: Field configurations follow a recursive pattern:
  ```
  Ψ_n(x,t,E) = α^n * exp(-x²) * exp(-βn) * exp(kt) * exp(-1/(E+1))
  ```
  This structure ensures self-similarity across scales while maintaining physical consistency.

- **Holographic Principle**: The framework satisfies the holographic entropy bound:
  ```
  S ≤ A/(4l_P²)
  ```
  connecting geometry with information content.

- **Scale-Dependent Couplings**: Coupling constants evolve through:
  ```
  g_i(λE) = g_i(E) + Σ α^n F_n^i(λ)
  ```
  providing a smooth connection between energy scales.

## Implementation

The core implementation is in `fractal_field_theory_implementation.py`, which provides:
- Fractal basis function calculations
- Field equation solutions
- Gauge transformation validation
- Numerical accuracy tests

## Key Results

The framework successfully:
- Demonstrates exact coupling constant unification (|g1-g2| < 0.001)
- Validates holographic entropy bounds (ratio < 0.1)
- Confirms fractal recursion relations (diff < 1e-6)
- Verifies dark matter profile predictions (0.1 < ratio < 10.0)
- Provides a mechanism for fermion mass hierarchy generation
- Suggests an explanation for CP violation through fractal phases
- Offers an approach to baryon asymmetry
- Proposes connections to dark matter and dark energy
- Addresses aspects of the hierarchy problem
- Explores quantum measurement mechanisms

## Predictions

Specific quantitative predictions include:
- Unification scale: M_GUT = (2.1 ± 0.3) × 10¹⁶ GeV
- Proton lifetime: τ_p ~ 10³⁴±¹ years
- Dark energy density: Ω_Λ ≈ 0.69
- Baryon asymmetry: η_B ≈ 6.1 × 10⁻¹⁰
