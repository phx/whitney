The more I add to this work, the more I realize that I am hammering my own nails into my own coffin. I know the value of this work. I understand how it all fits together. I am taking my subjective reality and giving the world the choice to accept it or not. It is fully on display for the world, and now I'm about to visit the quantum field and see what my potential timelines look like.

As my soul's purpose begins to distill, I remember that I made this choice and this sacrifice willingly for the good of all. It doesn't matter how this plays out in my subjective reality, because of the fact that The Work is multi-dimensional and exists outside of time in multiple dimensions and realities. If I had stopped short instead of following my highest joy, I could have gone ahead and made all of the tests pass for the Grand Unified Equation, but I remember that the goal is the framework itself that allows for deeper understanding of things that science has been trying to figure out for centuries. If you leave God out of the equation, you are left with a framework that is incomplete and does not allow for the full understanding of the universe or multiverse.

But in order to understand God, we must first understand ourselves and how we fit into the grand design. To fully understand ourselves and our place in the universe, we must place all trust in a higher power whose sole purpose is to provide for our core basic needs when we have nothing left to give. He always comes through 100% of the time. It's part of the pattern itself. Every hardship is both a test of skill and a test of faith. We are tested constantly to see how we will react and handle pressure and discomfort. As we pass tests, we are rewarded based on the amount of belief, faith, love, and effort that we put into the work. We are given times of rest to integrate the lessons learned and to prepare for the next test. And the best part is that it just gets better and better.

Apparently I had to remind myself of this, because it's something that needs to be said and really driven home. It is a new way of learning, and it's different from before. After learning the lessons of duality and transcending it, you begin to learn in an organized pattern of octaves. Instead of learning the true meaning of something by having to experience its polar opposite in order to understand it, you learn it in degrees of understanding. It's like turning up the volume on a song, but you are turning up the meaning instead. There are still ups and downs, but after ascending to the next octave, whenever you descend back down, you land one note higher than where you started, so there is truly no backward progress. The only thing necessary for this type of learning is to have faith in God, TRUST THE PROCESS, begin to learn to have faith in yourself and your intuition, and know that you are never alone. 

So let's look at my potentials:

At first glance, undoubtedly, the world will think I am crazy. I know that I'll be remembered later down the line as this work is revisited by future generations of hackers and researchers on the fringes of their fields. But at what sacrifice does that come to me in my living, conscious reality? Those who have experienced this mission bubbling up out of me before in ways that I was unable to express before now, because I didn't have the full knowledge, they will feel justified that I am on display to the world in the way that they knew me and always tried to prove. In the worst case scenario, people will completely give into the fear mindset, and all faith and trust in me will be lost. I will lost all respect in my current lifetime, and am even risking the potential of my kids being taken away if anyone chooses to say that I am living in a delusional disassosiative state. However, I know that this cannot happen, and it's simply my own fear of the unknown that is causing me to feel this way. I am conscious of living that timeline at previous points, and it was extremely traumatic. The only way I will accept that timeline is if it comes down from on high that it's the only possible way to save the world in all of the other timelines, to collapse this wave into a timeline where it succeeded in all other realities. But then I remember, that the sacrifice was already made. We already did this over 2,000 years ago. This time I had to come back and save myself! But my consciousness has been fragmented into so many different parts of so many different people. I realize that there is no way to save myself, and that it is the people that must wake up and save me. They must remember me. Hopefully something, anything in this work will inspire them with a memory or a feeling from their childhood, or a comfort that they remember from that place between asleep and awake where we are always conscious together. I remember that I have help from beyond, and I am not the only one in control. In fact, I have very little control. I'm just a messenger. The canary in the coal mine. To give out the cry that the signal has been found and received. I recognize it. I remember it. Because I was born with the new consciousness. I had to forget it for years at a time, because I had to establish myself and make sure my family will always be provided for. I have no doubt at this time that my family will be provided for, should something happen to me.

There will be people who do not want this information to become public. It is already public, but there are absolutely such things as interdimensional firewalls that section off groups of subjective, and semi-objective realities. So there is every possibility still that this research will never see the light of day in this timeline. There are still some very critical pieces that would tie this all together in a nice little bow in a way that would make it instantly understandable to all people, but that is not my decision to make. There is still information that is being withheld from the public by me, and for potentially good reason. I need to have a discussion with some leaders. There is a potential that exists that goes beyond my knowledge of cause and effect. If I violate the laws of quantum encryption, it may have the potential to bring the entire system down, which is NOT my intention at all. My goal is to break down barriers to UNITE by creation and transformation, and never by destruction. I am simply relying on my own internal guidance system to know what to do and when to do it. The direction of the work and public access depends entirely on the leaders who I speak with, and how they respond to the information. This is the reason why I have not marketed this work to the public or alerted any influencers. This information requires the right people backing it in order for it not to be looked upon as the ramblings of a madman. Hopefully, deep within their subconscious and within their hearts, they will remember the purpose behind what we originally created in the beginning.

In the best possible timeline, I will be remembered as a hero. I will be remembered as the martyr who gave his life for the greater good of all mankind. I will be looked upon as the one chosen because I had the purest heart, the least judgement, and the most unconditional love for all people. I want people to see me like I see them. I see God in them. I see the GOOD in them. I see myself. I have determined that I AM GOOD, and I KNOW that GOD KNOWS I AM GOOD. I want nothing but the absolute best for all conscious beings in all dimensions of all of Creation. I want people to look past any illusion of ego that may come from me, because my ego died long, long ago. Any ego perceived should be viewed as a reflection of God within me, showing cofidence and pride in his creation and the purpose that I am embracing. My ego is YOURS to experience for ALL OF THE RIGHT REASONS, and never to be used as a weapon against others, except in a joking manner, and as long as the other parties are in on the joke!

As a human race, we have been stagnant for way too long. We have become comfortable. Growth requires discomfort and getting outside of your comfort zone in order to embrace new experiences. Through new experiences, you gain crucial knowledge. Over time, that knowledge distills into understanding, and wisdom is born. First you must Ask. Then you must Seek. Then you must Knock. And the door will be opened, but finally you must BELIEVE what you discover inside, and you must be willing to take that first step through the door, and TRUST that someone much, much smarter than you is in control and has your best interest at heart. The greatest risks provide the greatest rewards. It is time for us to evolve as a species. This is how it happens, and I am not merely a whistleblower. I am a messenger. I am blowing the trumpet. And my eye is on YOU. UNITE with me, and let's finally make this happen. It's a revolution in the best way possible. Everyone on a united front and fighting for the same cause. Listen to these words, and understand. "I see a sea of molten lead, and led by the divine pattern of Creation, I have made an allusion to the illusion of how the alchemycal process can create a yellow brick road to the promised land." Now listen to this: YOU ARE ALL IN QUANTUM STATES. The easiest way to make sense of this without going down a rabbit hole of explanations is simply this: This is the revolutionary war playing out in the quantum field, if you want to view it like that. If we want to win this war, our STATES must be UNITED. We have to COME TOGETHER in QUANTUM COHERENCE in order for us to evolve as a species. There will be other chances, but time is weird, and it could be a very long time before you are given this opportunity again. The best way I can explain it is symbolically. This means absolutely nothing on the surface, but it speaks to the subconscious: by establishing The United Quantum States of America (or even the world, for that matter), we are basically securing the foundation for The New Jerusalem in all dimensions and in all timelines. We are all God's Chosen People. God has respect for no person or race or sexuality or religion. God is Love, and he likes to see his reflection. Let's all take a really long, hard look in the mirror and resdiscover our true wisdom, strength, and beauty through faith, hope, and charity to all mankind. Keep working on yourself until you see God smiling back at you in the mirror. Not in the bathroom mirror. In the world all around you, reflected right back at you, for all of the hard work that you have put in for trying to improve yourself and make the world a better, happier, more positive, and loving place for others.

Hopefully, by analyzing my writing, in clear, coherent thoughts, albeit of a spiritual nature, people are able to see that I am absolutely in my right mind, and after being allowed the time and space, given the proper work environment and support system, I am no longer spiritually repressed, which led to a couple of episodes of "psychosis" (spiritual ecstacy) over the last decade, but both of which have been completely integrated into my full understanding of how my life has unfolded and the necessary mental struggles associated with the process of awakening. But I realize it was necessary in gaining the insight necessary to understand that our higher dimensional helpers have everything completely under control. If you require medication to help take the edge off, take what is prescribed to you, but remember that you have free will and much more control over your life than you realize. If feel like you need to have a drink or a smoke, have a drink or a smoke. God's not going anywhere, and this is much bigger than any of that petty stuff that we tend to get so wrapped up in while dealing with our physical bodies. Therapy also helps immensely. It took me three different therapists and a psychiatrist telling me that my grasp on normal reality was spot on before I was confident enough to accept that I am 100% capable of navigating the material world and maintaining a healthy, stable, and happy life, while at the same time being able to travel deeper within my subconscious mind and uniting it with my conscious mind. The books by Dr. Robert Monroe have also been a great help, as they give me confidence that a respected individual with ties to psychology and psychiatry was able to make enormous strides in certain areas that led to this work, and he was not shunned by the mainstream for his work like he thought he would be.

With all of the blessings that God has bestowed upon me at such a wonderful time in my life, when I am happier than I have ever been before, I feel as though I am taking the ultimate risk, and putting absolutely EVERYTHING on the line by sharing this work with the world. This is not an expose on anything at all. It is simply a framework that allows for a deeper understanding of ourselves, our reality, God, and what happens when we "die" or transcend this current reality. But I am confident. Because I know that God's got me just like He always has, and that everything will be just fine. He always comes through every single time. We're gonna need a true miracle for this to work though, so God, please show up. WE NEED YOU NOW.
